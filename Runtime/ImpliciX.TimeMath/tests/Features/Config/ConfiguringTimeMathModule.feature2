Feature: Configuration
  As Application Configurator
  I want to add a TimeMath module to the configuration
  So that I will be able to view TimeMath for a time period

  Scenario: Adding TimeMath module to the configuration
    Given I have a simple "dev" profil
    And I add "TimeMath" to the "dev" profil
    When I start the "Calliper" application in "dev" mode
    Then the application does not start

  Scenario: Adding the complete TimeMath module to the configuration
    Given I have a simple "dev" profil
    And I add a "TimeMath" entry with the configuration
      """
        "Factory": "TimeMath",
        "Storage": {
          "ConnectionString": "127.0.0.1:6380"
        }
      """
    And I add "TimeMath" to the "dev" profil
    When I start the "Calliper" application in "dev" mode
    Then the application start
    And TimeMath are stored in the system
